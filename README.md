This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)
and bundled with [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/learn/) and [Redux-Toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit)
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Create a static HTML export:
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
This can be run standalone without the need of a Node.js server
